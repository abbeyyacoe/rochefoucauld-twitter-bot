# Rochefoucauld Twitter Bot
While reading the Maxims of Rochefoucauld, I felt he would have loved twitter. So I turned him into a bot. I took the Maxims from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/9105/9105-h/9105-h.htm)

I used [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) with the authentication.
